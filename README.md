# Multi-Material Manufacturing Process Planning Tools

## voxel-tools.py
Demonstration of functions for manipulating voxel data. Should be run with a path to a .vox file as only parameter.

### Working
- .vox file import
- Isolation of specific materials
- Conversion of voxel data to mesh cubes
- Model rendering with grids and axes

### To-do
- Boolean operations (add, subtract, intersect)
- Function to import a model at a specified location
